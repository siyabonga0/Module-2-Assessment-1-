                         <h3>Panda</h3>
                         <p> Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China.
                            These high bamboo forests are cool and wet—just as pandas like it.
                            They may climb as high as 13,000 feet to feed on higher slopes in the summer season.
                           Giant pandas grow to between 1.2m and 1.5m, and weigh between 75kg and 135kg. Scientists aren’t sure how long pandas live in the wild,
                            but in captivity they live to be around 30 years old.
