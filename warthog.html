                         <p>There are two species of warthog: The common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), which has four subspecies.
                           And then there’s the desert warthog (Phacochoerus aethiopicus), 
                           that has two subspecies – one of which went extinct in the 1870s.
                           The common warthog has the widest distribution in Africa, whereas the desert warthog is only found in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia.

                          The common warthog is found in much of Africa, below the Sahara desert.
                          ey are abundant in East Africa and Southern Africa, with their favourite habitat being grassland, savannah and woodlands.  </p>
