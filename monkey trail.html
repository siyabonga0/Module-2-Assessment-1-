                          <h3>Monkey-trail</h3>
                          <p> Many of the monkeys scampering around the forests of Central and South America have something special on their butts-- an extra hand. Well, not exactly. 
                            It's a prehensile tail-- a grasping appendage that helps the animals navigate the tall and treacherous canopy in search of fruits and leaves.
                             In fact, these tales are so handy that monkeys in the Americas have evolved them two separate times, and they've evolved dozens of times in other mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish.
                            But there's a big group of monkeys in which these handy appendages don't exist. In Africa and Asia, monkeys tails are just tails. Which is weird,
                            because those monkeys also spend all day monkeying around in the canopy and could presumably use an extra hand for foraging, too. So where are their special tails?
                             Our best guess is that the difference in tails is due to a difference in the forests where those tails appear. 
                             The forests in Central and South America are chock full of vines that monkeys use like tightropes to traverse between trees, so having an extra grip is helpful for balance and helpful in case of emergency</p>
