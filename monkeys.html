                         <h3>Monkey</h3>
                         <p> The term "monkey" is sometimes used as a catch-all for every animal in the primate family, but the truth is that monkeys live on completely different branches of the evolutionary tree from both apes (i.e., chimpanzees, gorillas, and humans) and prosimians (i.e., lemurs, tarsiers, and lorises). 

                           One big difference between monkeys and other primates is in the tail: Most monkeys have tails, while apes and other primates do not. Apes also tend to be larger than monkeys and, thanks to their larger brains, more intelligent.
                           For monkeys, picking bugs, dirt, and other debris off their companions is far from an indictment of their personal hygiene—it's an expression of affection and love. Grooming rituals not only keep monkeys healthy, they also strengthen their social bonds and, ultimately, make them feel more comfortable. 
                           Researchers have discovered that when vervet monkeys comb each other’s pelts, it fluffs the fur and makes it thicker. After a thorough grooming, the insulation value of the vervet monkey’s pelt increases by as much as 50%
