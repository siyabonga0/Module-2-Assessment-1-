                         <h3>Lion </h3>
                         <p>  A lion’s roar can be heard up to 5 miles away! Both males and females roar, 
                           and there are different types of roars to communicate different things.

                           Males roar to protect their territory, warn their prides of danger and show dominance among other males. 
                           Females roar to communicate with males during mating periods. Lions will also roar to let members of their pride know where they are. 
                           A time when lions don’t roar is during hunting, since the sound can scare away prey.

                         </p>

                        <p>You will find the Lion at pen E69, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
