                         <h3>Gemsbok</h3>
                         <p>The gemsbok or South African oryx (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. 
                           It is native to the extremely dry, arid regions of Southern Africa; notably, the Kalahari Desert.
                            Some authorities formerly classified the East African oryx, or beisa oryx, as a subspecies.

                           The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia,[3] where the current population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals
                           [1] In the town of Oranjemund, resident gemsbok wander freely around the streets, taking advantage of the vegetation in the town, such as the grass in parks,
                            road medians, and browsing on low branches of the many trees</p>

                           <p>You will find the Gemsbok at pen E192, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
